# Analog & Digital Circuit Design and Simulation

This repository contains the design and simulation of various analog and digital circuits using MATLAB/Simulink. The projects included demonstrate key concepts in electronics, covering both theoretical design and practical implementation.

## Projects

### 1. Audio Equalizer
- **Cutoff Frequency Range:** 250 Hz to 4 kHz
- **Components:**
  - **Active Low Pass Filter**
  - **Active High Pass Filter**
  - **Summing Amplifier**
  - **Inverting Amplifier**
- **Description:** An audio equalizer designed to filter and amplify audio signals across a specific frequency range. The design integrates multiple filters and amplifiers to achieve the desired audio output.

### 2. Power Electronics: Full-Wave Rectifier
- **Description:** A full-wave rectifier circuit that converts AC to DC. This project demonstrates the principles of rectification in power electronics, focusing on efficiency and signal integrity.

### 3. ADC and DAC
- **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**
- **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**
- **Description:** Simulation of ADC and DAC circuits to demonstrate the conversion between analog and digital signals. These circuits are fundamental in digital signal processing and communication systems.

### 4. Three-1s Pattern Combinational Circuit
- **Description:** A combinational logic circuit designed to detect a pattern of three consecutive '1's in a binary sequence. This project illustrates the design and implementation of digital logic circuits.
